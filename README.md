The default Etch A Sketch website is presented in a 16 x 16 grid, the individual grid items will be gray once the user sketches on it.

The website also features 3 different buttons that the user can use:

1. Reset Grid: The Etch A Sketch grid will be returned to its original state with no sketches.
2. Rainbow Mode: The sketch colors will be changed to a random RGB color for each grid item.
3. Update Grid: This will prompt the user for a new Etch A Sketch grid size. If a user enters 64, the grid will be updated to a 64 x 64 grid. Note, this functionality will only support a maximum grid of 100x100.
